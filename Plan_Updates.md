## Trajectory Surface Hopping - Simulation of excited state non-adiabatic dynamics

### Outline

We are interested to write a python layer for Trajectory Surface hopping over an existing electronic structure code.

### Plan

#### Improve the existing code into incorporate object oriented programming.
<b>Deadline</b>: Friday - 1st February  

#### Verify the code on Tully's models.
<b>Deadline</b>: Sunday - 3rd February
